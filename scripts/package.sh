# Assembles the files that are published on Typst Universe into <target>/preview/<name>/<version>/ (default target:
# dist/), the layout of `packages/` in https://github.com/typst/packages, so <target> also works as a package path:
# `typst init --package-path dist @preview/touying-ufac-unofficial:<version> deck`.
#
# Only the list below is published. The rest of the repository (tests, manual, scripts, CI) stays out of
# typst/packages, as its guidelines ask (docs/tips.md, "What to commit? What to exclude?"): the README reaches the
# manual and its pictures by their GitHub URL, at the tag of the version. `example/` is linked from the README by a
# relative path, so it is committed there, and `exclude` in typst.toml keeps it out of the archive that the compiler
# downloads.
